All calls to a command receive three things, so start with:
	my ($user, $tags, $args) = @_;

$user is the Twitch username of the user who invoked the command

$tags is a hash reference to all of the Twitch tags passed with the message. 
These are accessible as, for example, $tags{badges}. 
The &admin_test subroutine takes $tags as its argument:
if (&admin_test{$tags}) { do stuff }

$args is everything the user typed after the command, minus the leading space. 
It may be empty.



use whatever local variables you want
They will not pass between calls

for variables to persist between calls, use:
%vars{command}{variable}
and do whatever you want in that namespace

for data to persist between sessions (write to disk), use
%data{command}{variable}
In this case, each [variable] should be a single word, and its value should be
a string, rather than any sort of reference.
Multiple such variables can exist.

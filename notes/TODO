Things to do still:

* Actually make a units command, include github link and other info
* Pick a method for putting multiple lines of text in a file, like help, rules, etc.


Possible ideas for later:

* Let commands specify regex for chat messages to be processed?
** !vote could handle bare numbers; "1" rather than "!vote 1"
* Have main loop do a non-blocking check for input, to allow for timers
* Make an installer, once things get more stable

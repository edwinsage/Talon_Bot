Things to do still:

* Make a unit for creating simple commands
* Actually make a units command, include github link and other info
** Turn units on and off while running
** Save on/off configuration
* Fix namespace issues with unit-defined subroutines - need a non \w separator
** There are probably also scoping issues with defining subroutines this way
* Pick a method for putting multiple lines of text in a file, like help, rules, etc.
* Make debug messages more informative and standardized
* Create CGI listener for EventSub messages
** With a web interface?
** Maybe it runs the IRC bot when you go live?

Possible ideas for later:

* Let commands specify regex for chat messages to be processed?
** !vote could handle bare numbers; "1" rather than "!vote 1"
* Have main loop do a non-blocking check for input, to allow for timers
* Make an installer, once things get more stable
* Go multi-user

Things to do still:

* acknowledge votes
* vote count
* Provide a namespace for commands to store data.
** Volatile and persistent?
** Need to create persistent storage
* Actually make a units command, include github link and other info
* Allow command abbreviation via lookup table


Possible ideas for later:

* Mini-language / API for commands?  Commands-as-files?
* Let commands specify regex for chat messages to be processed?
** !vote could handle bare numbers; "1" rather than "!vote 1"
* Have main loop do a non-blocking check for input, to allow for timers

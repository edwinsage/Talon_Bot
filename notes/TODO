Things to do still:

* Make a unit for creating simple commands
* Save unit on/off configuration
* Make debug messages more informative and standardized
* Make startup information useful
* Make AGPL compliance easier - maybe a task for StreamTaffy integration
* Add config item for unit location(s)
* Tell commands what command name they were called under
* Pass commands a duplicate of %cfg, rather than the real one
* Make Twitch.pm into a proper module with Exporter
* * Use this to get rid of passing $cfg around by exporting an $auth hash

Possible ideas for later:

* Have main loop do a non-blocking check for input, to allow for timers
* Make an installer, once things get more stable
* Go multi-user

The helpfile is formatted as follows.  Help entries are contained in blocks,
 each block separated by a line starting with two ampersands. 
 Blank lines or lines containing only whitespace are ignored. 
 Within a block, the first line should be simply the command with
 exclamation point prefixed; if there are aliases for the command,
 they should be on the same line, separated by whitespace. 
 Further lines after the first will be sent to the user as-is
 when they request help for the named command.

The exception is a line containing only a + sign, which is used
 to separate extra help output intended for priveliged users,
 such as moderators, who have additional options when using some commands.

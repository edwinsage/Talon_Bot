The helpfile is formatted as follows.  Help entries are contained in
blocks, with every block terminating in a line starting with two
ampersands.  Blank lines or lines containing only whitespace are ignored. 
Within a block, the first line should be simply the command with
exclamation point prefixed; if there are aliases for the command, they
should be on the same line, separated by whitespace.  Further lines after
the first will be sent to the user as-is when they request help for the
named command.

After the initial line, each line of text will be output as a chat
message, until reaching the end of the block.  The exception is a line
containing only a + sign, which is used to separate extra help output
intended for priveliged users, such as moderators, who have additional
options when using some commands.

Talon_Bot - A simple Perl bot for Twitch
----------------------------------------

Talon_Bot is intended to be an extendable, hackable bot for Twitch chat.


Features:

* Several user commands

* Can create timestamped logs of chats

* An interactive help system


Requirements:

* A Twitch account, and an associated OAuth token as described in
  https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide

* Perl, minimum v5.20.  This could be lowered with little effort if needed,
  but for simplicity a non-ancient version is assumed.

* A POSIX environment to run in - Talon_Bot has only been tested on Linux,
  though it should presumably run well in other similar environments.
